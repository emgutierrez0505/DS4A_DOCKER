    "\n",
    "[External libraries (a.k.a. packages)](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Modules_and_Packages) are code bases that contain a variety of pre-written functions and tools. This allows you to perform a variety of complex tasks in Python without having to \"reinvent the wheel\" build everything from the ground up. We will use two core packages: ```pandas``` and ```numpy```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```pandas``` is an external library that provides functionality for data analysis. Pandas specifically offers a variety of data structures and data manipulation methods that allow you to perform complex tasks with simple, one-line commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "```numpy``` is a package that we will use later in the case that offers numerous mathematical operations. Together, [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/) allow you to create a data science workflow within Python. `numpy` is in many ways foundational to `pandas`, providing vectorized operations, while `pandas` provides higher level abstractions built on top of `numpy`.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import both packages using the ```import``` keyword. We will rename ```pandas``` to ```pd``` and ```numpy``` to ```np``` using the ```as``` keyword. This allows us to use the short name abbreviation when we want to reference any function that is inside either package. The abbreviations we chose are standard across the data science industry and should be followed unless there is a very good reason not to."

    "`pandas` is a Python library that facilitates a wide range of data analysis and manipulation. Before, you saw basic data structures in Python such as lists and dictionaries. While you can build a basic data table (similar to an Excel spreadsheet) using nested lists in Python, they get quite difficult to work with. By contrast, in `pandas` the table data structure, known as a `DataFrame`, is a first-class citizen and you can easily manipulate your data thinking of it in rows and columns.\n",

    "After the `for` loop, we've aggregated and added the relevant features we identified in the previous section. We then printed the tail of the aggregated DataFrame to have a peek at the format of the data, and we've also printed the shape of the DataFrame. This is to sanity-check that our final DataFrame is roughly what we expect. Notice the aggregated DataFrame has the same number of columns as the original single stock (D) data, however the number of rows have increased five-fold. This makes sense, because each additional symbol contains 1259 data entries, so five symbols leads to a total of ```1259*5 = 6295``` rows. So, this passes our sanity check."

Specifically, each item of the object is a tuple, containing the group identifier (in this case the `Symbol`), and the corresponding rows of the DataFrame that have that `Symbol`). You can think of the `groupby()` as a `for` loop through the values of a user-specified column and, in each iteration, extracts only those DataFrame rows that match that value in the specified column. The below diagram visualizes a `groupby()` operation over the column `foo`. Since there are only two values in `foo` (`one` and `two`), there are only two resulting groups:\n",

    "We also saw that each stock exhibited \"volatility clustering\" – periods of high volatility tend to be clumped together. Each of the stocks experienced high volatility at relatively similar times which suggests some broader market factor may be affecting the energy sector."

    "Going forward, we will be consistently using ```pandas``` as a data analysis framework (along with other tools) to build more complex projects and solve critical business problems. It is critical you become as familiar with ```pandas``` as possible and it is imperative that you continue researching/investigating new components of this library after the completion of this program. What we have taught here are only the essential basics of `pandas`; there is still a vast amount of power to the library that you will discover and utilize later on in your development as a data professional.\n",

    "We highly recommend revisiting this case a few more times and going through it from beginning to end with no aid/answers. You should know the various DataFrame/Series methods we introduced here as well as how to carry out common operations on data, such as finding percentiles, before you consider yourself to have \"mastered\" this material."
